falsePosition.m


The falsePosition.m algorithm estimates the root of a given function.

Inputs: • func - the function being evaluated • xl - the lower guess • xu - the upper guess • es - the desired relative error (should default to 0.0001%) • maxiter - the number of iterations desired (should default to 200)

Outputs: • root - the estimated root location • fx - the function evaluated at the root location • ea - the approximate relative error (%) • iter - how many iterations were performed

The algorithm will only work if the real root is bracketted with xl and xu.
