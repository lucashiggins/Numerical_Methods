Simpson_gh.m

The Simpson_gh.m algorithm integrates experimental data using the Simpson 1/3 method.

Inputs:
• x - the range of x values
• y - the range of y values

Outputs:
• I - the integrated value 

The algorithm will only work if the amount of x values is the same as y values. The spacing between intervals
must be the same. Simpson_gh.m will also use the trapeziodal rule on the last interval if there are an odd 
number of intervals. Every other interval will use Simpson's 1/3 rule.
